# Code Review Document

## Documentation Review
- Most classes lack proper Javadoc documentation for methods and attributes
- Need to add comprehensive documentation for all public and private members
- Class-level documentation is missing across all files

## Code Structure Analysis
1. **Blackjack.java**
- The game logic follows basic Blackjack rules
- Missing strategy options for player decisions (always hits under 16)
- Could benefit from constants for magic numbers (16, 17, 21)
- Need error handling for deck exhaustion

2. **Card.java**
- Well-structured with proper enums for Suit and Rank
- Good implementation of Comparable interface
- Random card generation could be moved to Deck class
- Consider adding card validity checks

3. **CardGameDriver.java**
- Handles both Blackjack and Lamarckian Poker games
- Missing command-line arguments for game configuration
- Hard-coded number of games (NGAMES)
- Could benefit from separation of game types

4. **Deck.java**
- Good implementation of deck operations
- shuffle() method could be optimized
- Consider adding deck validation
- Need documentation for shuffle algorithm

5. **Hand.java**
- Good implementation of hand value calculation
- Complex ace handling logic could be simplified
- Consider adding hand comparison methods
- Need validation for card addition/removal

6. **LamarckianPoker.java**
- Complex game logic needs better documentation
- Memory management issues with discarded cards
- Random number generation could be improved
- Need better error handling

## Identified Bugs
1. **IllegalArgumentException in LamarckianPoker**
- Occurs when selecting random cards from hands
- Root cause: Possible empty hand when selecting random card
- Solution: Add validation before random selection

2. **Potential IndexOutOfBoundsException in Blackjack**
- Can occur when deck runs out of cards
- Need to implement deck reshuffling
- Add validation for deck size

## Memory Leak Analysis
1. **LamarckianPoker Class**
- Discarded cards not properly managed
- Pool cards may not be properly cleared
- Need to implement proper object cleanup

## Recommendations
1. **Code Organization**
- Implement proper exception handling
- Add constants for magic numbers
- Improve documentation
- Add input validation

2. **Performance Improvements**
- Optimize card shuffling
- Improve memory management
- Add caching for frequently accessed values

3. **Testing**
- Add unit tests
- Implement edge case testing
- Add stress testing for deck handling

4. **Architecture**
- Separate game logic from UI
- Implement design patterns where appropriate
- Add proper logging system

## Implementation Priority
1. Fix critical bugs (IllegalArgumentException, IndexOutOfBoundsException)
2. Add proper documentation
3. Implement memory management improvements
4. Add validation and error handling
5. Optimize performance
